<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello!</p>

<p>My name is Abigail Derousselle, I am a graduate of Texas State University with a BS in Computer Science. Currently I am looking
   for a job in my field but, until then I am honing my skills by taking Udemy courses. I am making this portfolio website as a project
   for the course "Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with just ONE course...".
</p>

<p>I got into programming when I finished getting my Associates degree at Lonestar Community College and decided I was not happy with
   a Business Administration degree. I took an introductionary Python course and a criminal justice course. While I was good at both
   I found that programming was much more entertaining for me.
